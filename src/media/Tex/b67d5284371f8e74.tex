Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of character ch as we go through the string once, and each character is visited at most twice (once by right and once by left).\\Space Complexity is O of n due to the space required for the two pointers. The worst-case space usage occurs when traversing the string multiple times.\\
