I'd be happy to explain the algorithm to find the maximum number in an array!\\To find the maximum number in an array, you can simply sort the array in ascending order and return the last element, which would be the maximum number.\\In the case of the input array 1,2,3,4,5, the sorted array would be 1,2,3,4,5, and the last element is 5, which is the maximum number.\\
