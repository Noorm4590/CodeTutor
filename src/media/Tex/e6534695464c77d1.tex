2. Compare the word "4.5" with the current node's word (5). Since "4.5" is smaller, we go to the left subtree.\\3. At the left subtree, we find the node with word "3". Compare "4.5" with "3". Since "4.5" is greater, we go to the right subtree of "3".\\4. At the right subtree of "3", we find the node with word "4". Compare "4.5" with "4". Since "4.5" is greater, we insert it as a new right child of "4".\\
