\begin{document}
The slow pointer advances one step at a time, while the fast pointer advances two steps.\\By the time fast reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the node just before the one we want to remove.\\To prevent this from happening, we can use a dummy node to simplify the removal process by adjusting the pointers to the minimum of the two pointers and moving them towards each other.\\
