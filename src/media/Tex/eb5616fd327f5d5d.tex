The problem asks to find the length of the longest substring in a given string s without repeating characters.\\Use the sliding window technique where you maintain two pointers: a right pointer and a left pointer.\\Move the left pointer to explore new characters and the right pointer to check if the substring is a subsequence of a previous substring.\\
