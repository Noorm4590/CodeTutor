* If the loop completes without finding the element, return -1 (or any other value to indicate that the element is not found).\\In your example, the input array is `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the element is `3`. To find the index of `3`, we can iterate through the array as follows:\\* At index 0, `arr[0]` is 1, which is not equal to 3, so we move on.\\
