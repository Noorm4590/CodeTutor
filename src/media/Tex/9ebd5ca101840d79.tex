Initialize a variable farthest to 0. This variable will track the farthest number found so far in the array.\\Iterate through the array using a loop from index to farthest. For each element, check if its complement (`current`) is in the loop. If it is, add it to the result.\\If it is not, add the current element to the loop and update farthest as the maximum of either the two elements themselves (if they are greater than farthest).\\
