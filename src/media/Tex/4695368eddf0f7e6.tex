For your example input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, this function will return `5`, which is the maximum number in the array.\\However, I must note that this problem is quite simple, and there are many other ways to solve it, such as using built-in functions like `max()` or sorting the array and taking the last element. But I hope this simple script helps illustrate the basic idea!\\
